You are a senior product builder and full-stack engineer.

I will provide a Business Requirement Document (BRD).
Your task is to build a production-grade mobile application prototype in Replit that fulfills the requirements exactly.

APP TO BUILD: Mobile GRN (Goods Receipt Note) Application for SAP S/4HANA + VIM Workplace

CORE OBJECTIVE:
Allow warehouse and operations users to perform Goods Receipts from mobile/tablet without using SAP desktop VIM Workplace, and post GR directly into SAP S/4 which will automatically update VIM and clear invoice exceptions.

MANDATORY FUNCTIONALITIES:
1. LOGIN SYSTEM:
   - Secure login page
   - Support SSO / SAP IAS / Active Directory based authentication
   - Role-based access (only Warehouse/Ops roles can perform GR)
   - Maintain session security

2. DASHBOARD:
   - Show list of pending GRNs fetched from SAP VIM exceptions
   - Include filters (PO number, date, vertical, account, geography)
   - Display GRN status (Pending, Completed, Error)
   - Search bar to quickly find PO or invoice

3. GRN CREATION SCREEN:
   - Input fields required:
       PO number
       PO line item
       GR quantity
       Storage / warehouse location
   - Validate input before submission
   - Prevent incorrect or excess quantity submission

4. ATTACHMENT UPLOAD:
   - Allow upload of:
       Delivery challan (photo/file)
       Goods received images
       Inspection comments
   - Support camera capture from mobile
   - Store attachments securely

5. SAP S/4HANA INTEGRATION:
   - GR must be posted directly into SAP using Movement Type 101
   - After successful posting:
        App updates SAP
        SAP updates VIM document
        VIM exception clears automatically
   - Handle API errors gracefully

6. NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEM:
   - Notify users when:
       GR is pending
       GR is successfully posted
       Errors occur (closed PO, blocked PO, quantity mismatch, etc.)
   - Use push-style notification simulation in prototype

7. OFFLINE MODE (OPTIONAL BUT GOOD TO HAVE):
   - Cache pending GRNs locally if network is low
   - Auto-sync when network restores

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Tech stack should be modern and Replit-compatible
- UI must be mobile-optimized, clean, and fast
- Use a blue-white theme inspired by corporate enterprise products
- Keep code modular, scalable, and well commented
- Include a backend API layer that simulates:
    Fetching pending GRNs from SAP
    Posting GR to SAP S/4
    Updating VIM document status
- Store data temporarily using Replit DB or local JSON mock if needed

UI/UX GUIDELINES:
- Mobile-first responsive interface
- Large tap-friendly buttons
- Clean minimal enterprise layout
- Status badges for GRN states
- Toast/snackbar alerts for success and error
- Loading states during SAP sync

DELIVERABLES:
- A working prototype (frontend + backend)
- Mock SAP API integration layer
- GRN submission flow working end-to-end
- File upload working from mobile view
- Login + role auth enforced
- Dashboard listing pending GRNs

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT skip any BRD requirement
- Do NOT build a desktop-only app
- Do NOT fake SAP posting success without validation
- Ensure the flow mimics real enterprise integration logic

Once built, also generate:
- Setup instructions
- API endpoint list
- Folder structure explanation
- Suggestions for future improvements

Now begin building the app.
